# Totspots

Hi! My name is Daniel. Thank you for dropping by the Totspots repo.

Totspots is a trip-planning and reviews application built with the needs of parents in mind. The goal of this project is to provide parents of small children with need-to-know information about venues and events in their town, answering questions such as "Can I get a stroller in there?", "Do they have changing tables?" and "If my child has a meltdown, how long will it take us to get the check?"

The app functions based on user submitted reviews and suggestions for establishments in their town. All reviews are public and can be upvoted by other users. The venue/event's overall ratings are based on the average of these collected reviews.  Other features include the ability for users to save their favorite venues to their account as well as viewing and updating their previous reviews. 

## Using the client

At present, this app features venues and events from Durham, NC (a lovely city full of great places to be) which can be accessed from the search form on the landing page. If you would like to sign in to demo adding venues, favorites, voting, and posting/editing reviews, the login is: 

username: Daniel
password: password (all lowercase)

## Tech stack: 

The Totspots client was composed using React, Javascript, and CSS.

The API was composed using Node.js and the Express Router framework.

## Coming Soon

These features are cxurrently in backlog and will be added in future iterations:

1. Administrative tools, including the ability to verify suggested venues before they are published and the ability to delete reviews that might be false or misleading

2. Users will be able to comment and reply to comments on their reviews

3. Users will be able to register for their own account. 

4. Enhanced search functionality, including the ability to filter based on features offered

5. Users will be able to hide reviews will low vote count. 

6. Map display of venues around a user's location with distances and links to directions. 


The following contains documentation for getting started with React Apps. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
